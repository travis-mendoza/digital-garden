    <h1>Stuff I don't love</h1>

    <p>
        Noticing that something sucks creates an opportunity for ambitious people 
        to dream and invent better alternatives. In that spirit, I'll write down 
        some things that I think suck on this page.
    </p>

    <h3>men's shoes</h3>
    <p>
        I've been searching for comfortable, breathable shoes that pass for 
        business casual that I can wear just about anywhere and for any occasion.
        I love leather sneakers like the ones I've purchased from
        <a href="https://www.veja-store.com">Veja</a>,
        <a href="https://www.nike.com">Nike</a>, and
        <a href="https://www.thursdayboots.com">Thursday Boots</a>.
        They're beautiful, but leather does not breath.
        I'm looking for shoes that are stylish like that and stay comfortable 
        when I'm walking all day touring New York City in summertime.

    <h3>the Bay Area's urban sprawl</h3>
    <p>
        So many tech companies are in Palo Alto, Mountain View, Santa Clara, etc. But 
        it seems to me that 90% of the workforce for those jobs prefers to live in 
        San Francisco. This creates such an obnoxious commute for so many smart people.
        Can we please figure out how to headquarter more companies in San Francisco
        proper or build faster public transportation to move people between The City
        and Silicon Valley?
